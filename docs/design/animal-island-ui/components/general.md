# General — pixel spec

Pixel-level styling for the general-purpose components: Button, Icon, Typewriter and Cursor.

## Button

| Property      | small    | middle   | large    |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| height        | 32px     | **45px** | 48px     |
| padding       | `0 16px` | `0 20px` | `0 32px` |
| font-size     | 12px     | 14px     | 16px     |
| border-radius | 12px     | **50px** | 24px     |
| border-width  | 2px      | 2px      | 2px      |

**Exact values for the primary button (**only primary / danger-primary use the 3D thick shadow**):**

```css
color: #794f27;
background: #f8f8f0;
border-color: #f8f8f0;
font-weight: 600;
letter-spacing: 0.02em;
line-height: 1;
box-shadow: 0 5px 0 0 #bdaea0;

/* hover */
transform: translateY(-1px);
box-shadow: 0 6px 0 0 #bdaea0;

/* active */
transform: translateY(2px);
box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0 #bdaea0;

/* focus-visible */
outline: 2px solid #19c8b9;
outline-offset: 2px;

/* disabled */
opacity: 0.5;
```

**default / dashed / text / link buttons (soft elevation):**

```css
/* resting */
box-shadow: var(--animal-shadow-sm); /* 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(61,52,40,0.06) */

/* hover */
color: #19c8b9;
border-color: #19c8b9;
box-shadow: var(--animal-shadow-base); /* 0 3px 10px 0 rgba(61,52,40,0.10) */
transform: translateY(-1px);

/* active */
color: #11a89b;
border-color: #11a89b;
transform: translateY(0);
box-shadow: var(--animal-shadow-sm); /* falls back to the resting state */
```

> Never carry the primary `0 5px / 6px / 1px #bdaea0` stack over to default / dashed — the whole thing turns too heavy and too cartoonish.

**loading diagonal-stripe animation (exact values):**

```css
background: #0ec4b6;
border: 4px solid #4de2da;
color: #fff;
background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(-45deg, #0ec4b6, #0ec4b6 10px, #01b0a7 10px, #01b0a7 20px);
background-size: 28.28px 28.28px;
animation: animal-btn-loading 1s linear infinite;

@keyframes animal-btn-loading {
    0% {
        background-position: 0 0;
    }
    100% {
        background-position: -28.28px 0;
    }
}
```

**danger primary button:**

```css
color: #fff;
box-shadow: 0 5px 0 0 #c94444; /* error-active */
```

## Typewriter

```tsx
<Typewriter speed={90} trigger={openCount} autoPlay onDone={() => ...}>
  <p>Line one <strong>bold</strong></p>
  <p>Line two</p>
</Typewriter>
```

Props:

| name       | type          | default | Description                                                            |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `children` | `ReactNode`   | —       | Content to type out character by character; **the original element structure / line breaks / styles are preserved** |
| `speed`    | `number (ms)` | `90`    | Interval between characters                                             |
| `trigger`  | `unknown`     | —       | Any value change replays the animation (typically a modal open counter or an incrementing key) |
| `autoPlay` | `boolean`     | `true`  | `false` renders the full content immediately                            |
| `onDone`   | `() => void`  | —       | Fired when playback completes                                           |

**Implementation notes:**

- `countText(node)`: recursively counts the plain-text length of a ReactNode
- `renderTruncated(node, state)`: recursively truncates by remaining character count; `React.cloneElement` preserves the original nodes and their styles
- `useEffect` depends on `[total, speed, trigger, autoPlay]`, with an internal `setInterval` stepping `count` upward
- **No stylesheet**, and no extra DOM wrapper (returns `<>...</>`), so layout is completely unaffected

## Cursor

```tsx
<Cursor>
    <App /> {/* every element inside this subtree switches to the game finger cursor */}
</Cursor>

<Cursor type="raindrop">
    <App /> {/* raindrop cursor instead */}
</Cursor>
```

The stylesheet is **plain CSS** (`cursor.css`, not a CSS module) with two style variants selected by the `type` prop and two modes selected by the `forceAll` prop (default `true`); the root `<div>` carries `animal-cursor` plus a mode class (`animal-cursor--raindrop` is appended for the drop):

- `'default'` — bold-outline rounded arrow, 32×32 inline SVG, hotspot `8 5`
- `'raindrop'` — blue water drop, 32×32 inline SVG with a lighter highlight ellipse, hotspot `16 6`

**Arrow construction.** The arrow keeps the classic seven-vertex pointer silhouette (`M6 4 L6 21 L10.5 16.5 L13.5 23 L16.8 21.5 L13.8 15.2 L20.5 15.2 Z`) but **every corner is rounded and the stroke is very heavy** — that pairing is the whole style. A thick outline wrapped around a small bright core reads as a chunky, sticker-like pointer at any size, where a thin outline reads as a line drawing. The silhouette is scaled `1.12` so the shape plus its stroke fills roughly 75% of the 32×32 canvas height: an earlier 28×28 version left too much dead space, which forced the stroke so thick that the bright core vanished entirely. Stroke weight is therefore expressed as a **ratio of shape width (~15%)**, not a fixed pixel value, and has to be recomputed whenever the scale changes.

**Changing the scale factor is not a proportional edit.** The factor is applied to the seven base vertices only; the `1.8` left-edge tilt and the `1.2` hand-placed offset on `④` are applied *after* scaling and therefore stay fixed. At `1.36` that left the axis at `61.62°` and the edges at `23.19` / `7.87`; at `1.12` it moves the axis to `61.14°` and the edges to `19.12` / `6.35`. **Re-measure every number below after any scale change — never scale them by hand.** The stroke stays at `2.75`, so shrinking the silhouette raises its share of the outer width from 13.1% to 15.4%. That is deliberate — a smaller cursor still needs an outline of comparable visual weight — but `1.12` is the practical floor: any lower and the bright core starts closing up.

Corners are rounded with uneven per-vertex radii (tip `3.1`, tail `2.8`, notches `1.2`), and each corner is a `Q` whose control point sits on the original vertex. The **edges stay straight**: each one is an explicit `L` from the previous corner's exit point to the next corner's entry point, so the path reads `L Q L Q …`. Emitting only the `Q` chain — letting each quadratic span corner-to-corner, as the first version did — also renders the edge, and the vertex control point then drags long edges into a shallow bow of roughly `1` unit, worst on the left edge. The tip is deliberately **blunt** — a sharp tip would fight the heavy stroke and stop reading as a cursor. Fill and stroke live on **one** closed path, so no split-path trick is needed. The left edge's lower vertex is nudged right by `1.8`, tilting that edge slightly for a bit of hand-placed dynamism.

**The arrow is a strict mirror.** Only four vertices are free — `①` `②` `③` `④` — and `⑤` `⑥` `⑦` are each the reflection of `④` `③` `②` across the line through the tip at `61.14°` from horizontal (`28.86°` from vertical). Two consequences fall out for free and must not be "fixed" by hand: `①→②` and `①→⑦` are both `19.12`, and `②→③` and `⑥→⑦` are both `6.35`. Editing a free vertex therefore *forces* its partner to move, and pushing a partner past the axis breaks the pairing — work through the mirror, never around it.

Two earlier attempts are worth recording because they look reasonable and are wrong. Shortening the arm by sliding the notch `⑥` right is self-defeating: it moves `⑥` off its mirror position and breaks `②→③ = ⑥→⑦`. And the symmetry axis is emphatically **not** the vertical — both long edges are ~19 units on a 32-wide canvas, so a true vertical mirror would put the left edge at negative x. A previous version also hand-tuned four vertices independently and drifted out of sync; every one of those offsets is now gone.

Left-right "symmetry" here is a peripheral-weight judgement, not centring: even with the arm pushed as far right as it will go the ink centroid still falls short of the canvas centre (`14.5` against `16` at the current scale), because a classic arrow is asymmetric by construction. Never tune this axis against the centroid; judge it at real 32px.

The drop is **left as plain geometric geometry** — a round-capped path plus a highlight ellipse. Softening it was tried and reverted: rounding a teardrop's apex just makes it read as a blob.

**Text selection.** The `default` variant also restyles selected text inside its subtree: `#e9c46a` background with `#2b2620` text. The text color is not optional — the design system's body color `#794f27` on that background is only **4.25:1**, which misses AA for body text, while `#2b2620` reaches **8.97:1**, past WCAG AAA.

The two variants are carried by custom properties (`--animal-selection-bg` / `--animal-selection-fg`) that the raindrop rule overwrites with the system colors `Highlight` / `HighlightText`. This is not cosmetic. A plain `.animal-cursor:not(.animal-cursor--raindrop) ::selection` looks equivalent but breaks twice over, because a Cursor is very often nested inside another one (the demo wraps its whole page in a `default` Cursor):

- a descendant combinator matches a raindrop nested in a default at **any depth**, so the drop gets painted `#2b2620`
- a top-level raindrop matches **nothing at all**, and silently loses any selection styling

Custom properties resolve against the *nearest* declaring ancestor, so the innermost Cursor always wins with no `!important` and no `:not()` gymnastics.

**The images live in CSS custom properties** so all the variant and mode rules share them; editing the artwork means editing one declaration per variant, not touching four rules:

```css
/* artwork + hotspot declared once, inherited down by every descendant */
.animal-cursor {
    --animal-cursor-img: url("data:image/svg+xml,…bold-outline arrow…");
    --animal-cursor-hotspot: 8 5;
}
.animal-cursor--raindrop {
    --animal-cursor-img: url("data:image/svg+xml,…water drop…");
    --animal-cursor-hotspot: 16 6;
}
/* force mode (default, forceAll={true}): every descendant gets the custom cursor.
   Custom properties inherit, so descendants resolve the right variant automatically. */
.animal-cursor--force,
.animal-cursor--force * {
    cursor: var(--animal-cursor-img) var(--animal-cursor-hotspot), default !important;
}

/* scoped mode (forceAll={false}): only the container shows the custom cursor …
   (double-class selector so a scoped Cursor nested inside a force Cursor still wins) */
.animal-cursor.animal-cursor--scoped {
    cursor: var(--animal-cursor-img) var(--animal-cursor-hotspot), default !important;
}

/* … while descendants fall back to browser semantics */
.animal-cursor--scoped *,
.animal-cursor.animal-cursor--scoped * {
    cursor: auto !important;
}

/* interactive elements restore pointer */
.animal-cursor--scoped a[href],
.animal-cursor--scoped button,
.animal-cursor--scoped [role='button'],
.animal-cursor--scoped [role='link'],
.animal-cursor--scoped label[for],
.animal-cursor--scoped select,
.animal-cursor--scoped summary,
.animal-cursor--scoped input[type='button'],
.animal-cursor--scoped input[type='submit'],
.animal-cursor--scoped input[type='reset'],
.animal-cursor--scoped input[type='checkbox'],
.animal-cursor--scoped input[type='radio'],
.animal-cursor--scoped [data-cursor='pointer'] {
    cursor: pointer !important;
}

/* text inputs keep the text cursor */
.animal-cursor--scoped input[type='text'],
.animal-cursor--scoped input[type='search'],
.animal-cursor--scoped input[type='email'],
.animal-cursor--scoped input[type='password'],
.animal-cursor--scoped input[type='number'],
.animal-cursor--scoped input[type='tel'],
.animal-cursor--scoped input[type='url'],
.animal-cursor--scoped textarea {
    cursor: text !important;
}

/* disabled state wins */
.animal-cursor--scoped [disabled],
.animal-cursor--scoped [aria-disabled='true'] {
    cursor: not-allowed !important;
}
```

- The artwork is inline SVG only — there is no `cursor-icon.png` and no base64 fallback; both variants are defined once in `cursor.css` and reach every rule through `--animal-cursor-img`
- `!important` on every rule so the mode semantics survive component-level cursor styles; `className` is applied to the root `<div>` alongside the fixed `animal-cursor` class
